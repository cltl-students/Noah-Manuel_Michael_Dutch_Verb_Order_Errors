1. Unzip the file.

2. Open a terminal.

3. Navigate to this directory (Annotations) with the cd command.

4. Make sure you have pandas installed, otherwise install with
% pip install pandas

5. Run the script with
% python confirm_annotations.py (Windows OS) or
% python3 confirm_annotations.py (Linux or Mac OS)

You can pause and resume the annotation process at any point by closing 
the terminal or interrupting the process with ctrl+c and repeating
steps 2, 3, and 5.

Thank you!
